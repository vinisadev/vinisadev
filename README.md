# Hi there! 👋🏼 I'm Vin!

I love building software that solves my pain points with already existing software.

I have over 2 decades of experience writing various types of software from web applications, mobile apps, and beyond.

I enjoy learning new technologies, and building outside of my comfort zone which allows me to grow in the Software Development field.
